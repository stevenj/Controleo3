## BUILDING

This software is stand alone and requires no libraries.  Just set Arduino IDE up for ***Arduino/Genuino Zero (Native USB Port)*** and build *(verify)* ReflowWizard.ino

## HARDWARE SPECIFICATION

### Processor

The processor is an Atmel/Microchip [ATSAMD21J18](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATsamd21j18)

Maximum SERCOM SPI Rate of the ATSAMD21 is 12Mhz.

### GP Outputs

Outputs 1 through 5 Control n-channel MOSFETs, which switch 4.5V (5V less schottky diode) at up to 240mA.  Terminated on Screw Terminals, active low with a common positive line.  Output 6 is a RAW output on the board, and could also be used as an input.

#### GPO - Pin Assignment

| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| PA15          | 5           | OUTPUT 1      | Low Side Switch                                      |
| PB30          | Not Mapped  | OUTPUT 2      | Low Side Switch                                      |
| PB17          | Not Mapped  | OUTPUT 3      | Low Side Switch                                      |
| PB09          | A2          | OUTPUT 4      | Low Side Switch                                      |
| PB08          | A1          | OUTPUT 5      | Low Side Switch                                      |
| PB11          | SCK         | OUTPUT 6      | RAW GPIO - Used by this software a debug led signal. |

### Servo Output

A Servo output is available.  Servo Control uses Timer Counter 3 for Timing control.  A 1-2ms pulse every 20ms.

#### SERVO - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | FUNCTION      | Note                       |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| PB31          | SERVO OUTPUT  | TCC0/WO[1] TCC1/WO[3]      |

#### SERVO - Notes

The current driver uses Timer Counter 3 (TC3) even though the output is
connected to TCC0 and TCC1.  Using either TCC0 or TCC1 gives a hardware PWM output more than adequate for producing a 1-2ms pulse in a 20ms period as required by the Servo.  The current driver is done all with software and interrupts.  Using the hardware resources will give Servo Control with no CPU overhead.

### Thermocouple: MAX31856

A [MAX31856](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31856.pdf) thermocouple is used to read oven temperature.

#### Thermocouple - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | Arduino IO    | FUNCTION     | Note          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| PA20          | 6             | MISO         | SERCOM5/3[2]  |
| PA21          | 7             | MOSI         | SERCOM5/3[3]  |
| PA22          | 20            | CLK          | SERCOM3/5[0]  |
| PA23          | 21            | CS           | SERCOM3/5[1]  |

#### Thermocouple - Notes

The MAX31856 is an SPI device, AND it is connected to the SERCOM 5/3 which can implement hardware SPI.  BUT Because it as been inexplicably wired up in such a way as to prevent the use of hardware SPI, it MUST BE BIT BASHED.  This is totally unnecessary and a waste of hardware resources.  **BAD HARDWARE DESIGN that must be corrected with software.**

### SDCard Interface

An SD Card interface is available, and is using the SDCard in SPI Mode.

#### SDCard - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | FUNCTION     | Note                                   |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| PA2           | CD           | SD Card Detect                         |
| PA4           | MISO         | SERCOM0[0] - SERCOM DI (DIPO 0x0)      |
| PA5           | CLK          | SERCOM0[1] - SERCOM CLK (DOPO 0x0/0x2) |
| PA6           | MOSI         | SERCOM0[2] - SERCOM DO  (DOPO 0x1)     |
| PA7           | CS           | SERCOM0[3] - CS Software Controlled    |

#### SDCard - Notes

The SDCard is an SPI device, AND it is connected to the SERCOM 0 which can implement hardware SPI.  BUT Because it as been inexplicably wired up in such a way as to prevent the use of hardware SPI, it MUST BE BIT BASHED.  This is totally unnecessary and a waste of hardware resources.  **BAD HARDWARE DESIGN that must be corrected with software.**

It MAY be possible to use hardware SPI for READ ONLY, but for any Write or full duplex operation the SPI must be bit bashed.

Note, the software also contains a comment seemingly bragging about a low low speed of 1.25Mhz bit bashed as some sort of accomplishment.  It is very strange.

SD Card Detect is an Input.  To read the state it needs to be configured: INPUT ENABLE, PULL ENABLED and the OUT REGISTER SET TO PULL UP.  Otherwise it can not be read at the input.
0 = Card Inserted
1 = Card Removed

### LCD

The board has a 480x320 LCD driven by a [ILI9488](https://www.buydisplay.com/download/ic/ILI9488.pdf) LCD Controller.

#### LCD - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO  | FUNCTION     | Note                     |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| PB0-PB7    | D0-D7        | 8 Bit Parallel LCD Data  |
| PB12       | RD           | LCD READ Strobe          |
| PB13       | WR           | LCD WRITE Strobe         |
| PB14       | D/CX         | LCD Data/Command Address |
| PB15       | CS           | LCD Chip Select          |
| PB16       | RESET        | LCD Reset                |

#### LCD - Notes

The LCD is capable of 18 bit mode, but 16 bit mode is used for performance reasons.  The hardware has no parallel bus support so the LCD Bus is done manually.

### LCD Touchscreen

A SPI LCD Touchscreen controller is connected.  The controller is a [XPT2046](https://www.buydisplay.com/download/ic/XPT2046.pdf)

#### LCD Touchscreen - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO  | FUNCTION     | Note          |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| PA8        | CLK          | SERCOM0/2[0]  |
| PA9        | CS           | SERCOM0/2[1]  |
| PA10       | MOSI         | SERCOM0/2[2]  |
| PA11       | MISO         | SERCOM0/2[3]  |
| PB10       | IRQ          |               |

#### LCD Touchscreen - Notes

The LCD Touchscreen is an SPI Device.  It is connected to the pins of a SERCOM which provides hardware SPI.  HOWEVER, because of a ridiculous pin assignment HARDWARE SPI can not be utilized and this device **MUST BE BIT BASHED.**  The CLK Line is on PAD0, which is not an available CLK Pin.

### Onboard Flash: W25Q80BV

The W25Q80BV(8M-bit) Serial Flash is organized into 4,096 programmable pages of 256-bytes each.  The W25Q80BV supports the standard Serial  Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance Dual/Quad output as well as Dual/Quad I/O SPI.

#### FLASH - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | FUNCTION      | Note         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| PA13          | CLK           | SERCOM2/4[1] |
| PA14          | CS            | SERCOM2/4[2] |
| PA16          | MOSI          | SERCOM1/3[0] |
| PA17          | MISO          | SERCOM1/3[1] |
| PA18          | WP            | SERCOM1/3[3] |
| PA19          | HOLD          | SERCOM1/3[4] |

#### FLASH - Notes

  Due to the pin assignment it is impossible to use a SERCOM to read/write the external flash and it must be bit bashed.  Quad SPI is available, which might improve performance for bit bashing.  To equal the SPI Hardware Rate of 12Mhz, the Bit bash routine needs to read a 4 bit qty every 16 CPU Clock Cycles (Sustained).

  The current driver uses QSPI mode for this chip uses 4 bit mode for reading/writing.

### Piezo Buzzer

A Piezo Buzzer is on board.

#### Piezo Buzzer - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | FUNCTION              | Note                |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| PA12          | TCC2/WO[0] TCC0/WO[6] | Piezo Buzzer Output |

### USB

USB is on board and is being used to create a virtual serial port for dumping information to a connected PC.  I don't know if its Device only or OTG capable.

#### USB - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | FUNCTION              | Note                |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| PA24          | USB/DM                | USB Bus Line        |
| PA25          | USB/DP                | USB Bus Line        |

### Debugging

SAMD21 exposes the standard ARM SWCLK/SWDIO and they can be used for programming the boot loader as well as debugging.

#### Debugging - Pin Assignment

| SAMD21 IO     | FUNCTION              | Note                |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| PA30          | SWCLK                 | Serial Debug Clock  |
| PA31          | SWDIO                 | Serial Debug IO     |

#### Debugging - Notes

When not being used for Serial Wire Debugging, these IO can be used in this software to
flash a connected LED.  For Debugging Purposes.

Peter Easton 2017 (V1.0 to 1.4) whizoo.com

**This code has branched at V1.4 and likely will not track upstream.  Various refactors that I would like to do will make that increasingly difficult.**

* 1.5s Refactor and improvements
  * This is a work in progress, as at 19 May 2018 it builds fine and runs on the hardware.  No functional changes have yet been introduced.
  * Renamed all .ino files other than the primary one into .cpp and added headers.  Because multiple .ino is UGLY and ends up all catted together into one big mess.  This is a structural change only and introduced no changes in behavior or functionality.
  * Planned changes (in no particular order):
    * A mod to use 100% of the ovens heating power during heat up when the target temp is a long way away.
    * Configurable max power settings for the 3 elements.
    * Fix the Servo to use hardware instead of a ISR and bit toggling
    * Try and make the SDCard reads faster using hardware SPI.
    * Improved Temperature reading code.  Currently the code averages over a period of 3 Seconds, which doesn't (contrary to the comments in the code) make the readings more stable, what it actually does is introduce a large delay into the ability for the oven to detect changes in the temperature.  It is also doing temperature readings as part of the Servo Code, which is ugly.
    * Use hand tuned assembler for all the unnecessary bit bashed spi this board needs, because the hardware design is broken and can not use any hardware SPI for pretty much anything (except maybe SDCard reading).
    * Fix a lot of the ugly direct IO code to use Atmel ASF types, when i am not using hand tuned assembler.
    * An ability to save the onboard flash contents to the SDCard.
    * An ability to update the onboard flash contents from the SDCard.
    * Would love to move the code off Arduino all together, and use a modern compiler, not a 4 yr old one.
